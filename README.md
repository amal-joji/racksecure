#RackSecure – Stop The Thieves, Protect The Racks!  

"Thieves think they’re slick… but our AI is slicker!"

What is RackSecure?  
RackSecure is an AI-powered theft detection system that keeps an eye on publicly shared racks and catches thieves red-handed!   

Using YOLOv8, Ultralytics, and OpenCV, it detects when someone takes an item that’s not theirs and sends instant alerts!

Perfect for:
Libraries
Co-working Spaces  
Hostels & Public Racks   
Retail & Warehouses   


WORKING:
Object Detection – Uses YOLOv8 to scan racks in real time 
Motion Tracking – Monitors item movement using OpenCV  
Theft Detection – AI flags unauthorized removals  
Alert System – Triggers alarms, notifications, or logs the event
